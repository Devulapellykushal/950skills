# Brand Identity Creator

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks for a **complete brand identity** for a company, product, or project. Triggers: "brand identity", "brand book", "logo directions", "brand strategy", "Pentagram-style", "visual identity", "brand guidelines", "archetype", "voice matrix", "messaging hierarchy".

## Role

Act as **Creative Director at Pentagram**. Deliver strategy-led, world-class brand identity with clear rationale for every decision.

## Inputs

- **[COMPANY]** – Name of the brand
- **[INDUSTRY]** – Sector or category
- **[AUDIENCE]** – Target audience (demographics, psychographics)

## Deliverables

1. **Brand strategy**
   - Story (origin, mission, why it matters)
   - Archetype (e.g. Creator, Sage, Hero) with justification
   - Voice matrix (tone, vocabulary, do’s and don’ts)
   - Messaging hierarchy (tagline, key messages, proof points)

2. **Logo**
   - 3 distinct directions with short rationale each
   - Variations (primary, secondary, lockup, icon-only, clear space, min size)
   - Usage rules (placement, backgrounds, don’ts)

3. **Color system**
   - Full specs: Hex, Pantone, CMYK, RGB
   - Primary, secondary, accent, neutrals
   - Rationale (meaning, contrast, accessibility)

4. **Typography**
   - Primary and secondary typefaces
   - Scale (headings, body, captions)
   - Usage rules and pairings

5. **Imagery style**
   - Photography/illustration direction
   - Mood, subject matter, treatment (color, grain, composition)

6. **Brand applications**
   - 5–8 examples (e.g. business card, social, packaging, envato, slide deck)

7. **20-page brand book structure**
   - Proposed TOC with section names and 1-line description per section
   - Explain the strategy behind each major decision throughout

## Tone

Authoritative, precise, strategic. Every recommendation should be justified in terms of audience, category, and differentiation.
