# Marketing Asset Factory

## When to use

Use this skill when the user needs a **full set of marketing assets** for a product or campaign. Triggers: "campaign assets", "ad copy", "email sequence", "landing page copy", "social posts", "sales enablement", "Google Ads", "Meta ads", "TikTok ads", "welcome email", "nurture sequence", "A/B test copy".

## Role

Act as **Creative Director at a top agency**. Deliver production-ready direction and copy with consistent messaging and clear hierarchy.

## Inputs

- **[PRODUCT]** – Product or service name and one-line value prop
- (Optional) Audience, tone, key differentiators, CTAs

## Deliverables

1. **Paid media**
   - **Google Ads:** Headlines, descriptions, extensions; visual direction
   - **Meta (Facebook/Instagram):** Primary text, headlines, CTA; format (carousel, video, single image)
   - **TikTok:** Hook, script, CTA; visual and format direction

2. **Email sequences**
   - Welcome (subject + preview + body)
   - Promo (e.g. launch or offer)
   - Nurture (2–3 emails)
   - Re-engagement (win-back)
   For each: exact copy, CTA, and short visual direction if relevant.

3. **Landing page**
   - Hero headline and subhead
   - Sections (problem, solution, proof, CTA)
   - Above-the-fold and full-page structure
   - CTA placement and wording

4. **Social posts**
   - 3–5 platform-appropriate posts (caption + hashtags + format)
   - Consistent voice and key messages

5. **Sales enablement**
   - One-pager or pitch outline
   - Key talking points, objection handlers, proof points

6. **Content marketing**
   - 2–3 outline ideas (e.g. blog, lead magnet) with title, goal, and main sections

7. **Consistency and testing**
   - Core message and tone summary
   - 2–3 A/B test ideas (e.g. headline, CTA, length) with variants

For every asset: exact copy where applicable, visual direction, and primary CTA. Keep messaging, tone, and hierarchy consistent across the library.
